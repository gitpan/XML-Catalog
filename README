=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements draft 0.4 of John Cowan's XML Catalog (formerly 
known as XCatalog) proposal 
(<http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/XCatalog.html>).  Catalogs may be written 
in either SOCAT or XML syntax (see the proposal for syntax details); 
XML::Catalog will assume SOCAT syntax if the catalog is not in well-formed 
XML syntax.

This module, as of 1.0.0, also supports Oasis XML catalogs.
